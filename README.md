# CryptoRadar
A Python repository focused on applying Data Science to trade cryptocurrencies on Binance Exchange

## Introduction

A friend of a friend I met not so much ago told me that he had decided to trade a small sample of cryptocurrencies on Binance Spot Market, he shared with me the fact that he, even though had never purchased any trading course (*and seemed not interested in doing so in the short term*), was making some small yet consistent profits on a daily basis. He even went further and showed me his net worth graph over the last 2 weeks, it was clear that he wasn't lying, and he also told me that he didn't even use any type of indicator to make his trading decisions.

He told me that the only thing he did was to eyeball at which range of prices his sample of cryptocurrencies were fluctuating, for then setting buy signals with the Binance Mobile App, the first one to activate its corresponding signal would be the first to be traded (*that was his rule*) and then he just proceded to market buy that one for then inmmediately placing the sell order 2% (*never more never less*) above the price he purchased at, he never used leverage nor marging, and just stayed patient until his sell order got filled (*usually between 1 and 48 hours depending on the trading pair and market conditions*).

This project was created with the aim of making a good, yet simple, statistical analysis on the Binance Spot Market based on the "way" this guy was trading, to finally understand why he was indeed making small profits consistently.
